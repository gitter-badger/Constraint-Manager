# First questionnaire

## Interface (interfaces/rgmii.yaml)
- Is this enough information to go create a new interface?  If not, what to add?

- Okay level of flexibility?  Hopefully misc category provides anything missing

- General comments?

## Part (parts/rgmii_part_123.yaml)
- Is this enough information to go create a new RGMII part?  If not, what to add?

- Anything to add?  Plan to add tags in the future for search already, not much else needed here

- General comments?

## Design (tmp/dsn1_red_rgmii.yaml)
- Is this enough information to go create a new design using the existing RGMII part and interface?  If not, what to add?

- Like having default in page, or just set value=default and remove default?

- Does this need comments?  Adding comments to generated file is a pain in yaml, so not possible right now but could with extra work

- General comments?
